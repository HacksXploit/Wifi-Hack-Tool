This script can pick up a password from user's databases to WiFi networks.

To hack (or not :3 ) WiFi you...

At the first you need to choose an index of victim's WiFi network from a list at the beginning. 
Then you should enter a timing (script need to wait some for connecting to net).
And wait, program will check all paswords from DB one after another and will stop if found one-correct.
